The whole idea of OOPSIE is to make it easy for you to create your ideas and be ready for the big world without all the hassle of maintaining a complex server infratructure OOPSIE will do that for you out-of-the-box. Doesn't matter if you are gonna create a small personal application or if you want to push Big Data from your enterprise systems for later analysis. With a few drags and clicks you can create full fledged scalable applications and have it running within minutes.

Do you really need:
 - To code huge and complex backends? 
 - A huge operation department to handle your server and scale with your business? 
 - To get stuck in an architecture where you can't scale because your backend is not made for it?

 **NO, and why should you!**

 In this Guide To OOPSIE you will ( hopefully ) find everything you need to know how to create and deploy sites with OOPSIE. If anything is missing, please contact us or give us a pull-request to this documentations repository.
